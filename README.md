# tjdgkt.js blog web application

## Hello, and welcome to the blog application. The purpose of this readme is to describe the setup for further development. 

In order to create, update, or delete posts, run 
```
python3 manage.py runserver
```
when in the 'backend' folder and visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin when running the server.

In order to read blog posts, first change directories into the frontend folder then run
```
npm run serve
```

this will allow you to see if blog posts are properly being displayed. 

That is all for now, further updates will be made whenever I have a breather from schoolwork.
